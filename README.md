Code that was used for the results presented in the paper: "Unsupervised Clustering with Smoothing for Detecting Paratext Boundaries in Scanned Documents."
The process of retrieving content of the books from the Hathi Trust Digital Library and from the HathiTrust Extracted Features dataset is shown.
The process of extracting features from each page of the book is demonstrated, visualizing pairwise distances between pages, and finally clustering the pages
based on the distance between them.
Majority vote smoothing is applied on the results. 
The main content of a work is delineated and separated from paratextual elements in this way.
