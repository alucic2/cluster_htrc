## Motivation for the development of this method
This work started as part of the [Reading Chicago Reading project](https://dh.depaul.press/reading-chicago/) at DePaul University in 2018. Reading Chicago Reading project received the HathiTrust Research Center Advanced Collaborative computational support grant to explore a set of in copyright and out of copyright works related to the [One Book One Chicago](https://www.chipublib.org/one-book-one-chicago/) program that were included in the [Extracted Features](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets) dataset. To be able to constraint the extraction of features from the main content only and exclude paratext (e.g. Table of Contents, Epilogue, Bibliography, Critical Introduction), we needed to know where the main content of a work begins and ends. Paratext boundaries are not a consistent metadata element that researchers can rely on. Even if such information exists in the accompanying metadata files, this information needs to be verified.
## Modeling paratext as the outlier of main work
Paratext elements lend themselves well to being modeled as outliers of main work. As the amount of paratext increases in a volume, it is harder to establish the beginning and end of the main content. Including paratext in the analysis of a work has an influence on the measures extracted from the text (e.g. number of geographical entities extracted from a work, number of personal names, proportion of part-of-speech elements depending on whether or not the Index or Critical Introduction is included.
## Future work
We plan to continue developing this method to establish its bounds of accuracy and also to find out how different paratext elements lends themselves to being identified in a work.
